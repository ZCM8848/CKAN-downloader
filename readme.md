#   CKAN downloader  
This is just a simple python script to download all mods in [CKAN's meta](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN-meta/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) of all versions...  
And, I believe there would be a lot to do if someone downloaded all of this :D (for example, build a mirror server etc.)  
*Also remember to change your CKAN cache path to your former path after using this!*
